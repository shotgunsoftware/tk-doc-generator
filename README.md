# Shotgun/Toolkit Documentation Generator

This repository makes it easy to generate documentation for 
Shotgun and Toolkit related repositories.

## When do I need this?

If you are releasing Toolkit apps, engines, frameworks or
any other Shotgun related integrations, tools or APIs, 
this repository can accelerate your documentation process.

## What does it do?

You include this repository as a git submodule in your 
repository and it will convert markdown and sphinx 
documentation into a website with the same look and 
feel as [developer.shotgunstudio.com](https://developer.shotgunstudio.com). It makes the 
process of generating reference documentation, guides,
FAQs and tutorials easy.

## How do I use it?

Check out the documentation:

- [How to set up the doc generator with your repository](https://developer.shotgunsoftware.com/tk-doc-generator/53726823).

- [How to author and release documentation](https://developer.shotgunsoftware.com/tk-doc-generator/19bd79d8/?title=Introduction).

## Examples of documentation

Apart from the documentation links above, a great way to understand
a system is to look at how it is being used in practice. Below are some examples of what documentation sites generated with the generator
looks like, along with their source markdown:

- This repository's documentation: [[docs](https://developer.shotgunsoftware.com/tk-doc-generator)] / [[source](https://github.com/shotgunsoftware/tk-doc-generator/tree/master/docs)].

- The Shotgun developer site: [[docs](https://developer.shotgunsoftware.com)] / [[source](https://github.com/shotgunsoftware/shotgunsoftware.github.io/tree/master/docs)].
