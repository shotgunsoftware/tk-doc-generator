# Managing a table of contents

To modify the table of contents, you need to change two files:

- A `docs/_data/toc.yml` table of contents structure file.
- A `docs/_data/en/toc_text.yml` file containing localized strings. 
  In this case, the path points at the english strings. The entries 
  added to this file will normally be translated into additional 
  languages as a secondary activity. As an example, the japanese
  version of this document would be `docs/_data/ja/toc_text.yml`.

{% include info title="Moving and renaming pages" content="The location of a page in the table of contents, and the page's title ([specified in the slug](../authoring.md)) determine the page's location and name.  Renaming or moving a page is accomplished by changing these values, and not it's pagename, as the pagename is only used internally." %}

## The toc file

The `docs/_data/toc.yml` defines the structure of the table of contents.

For example, it may look like this:

```yaml
- caption: authoring
  children:
  - page: authoring
  - page: authoring-markdown
    children:
    - text: markdown-cheatsheet
      url: https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet
  - page: authoring-figures
  - page: authoring-toc
    children:
    - page: toc-file-structure
      children:
      - page: toc-nesting
  - page: authoring-landing-page
  - page: authoring-preview

- caption: setting-up
  children:
  - page: installation-integrating
  - page: installation-languages

- caption: developing
  children:
  - page: developing-tech-details
```

- The `caption` nodes will be displayed as blue, nonclickable headings in the TOC.
- Each `caption` node has a list of children in a `children` key.
- Items in this `children` list can either be other documentation pages or extenrnal links.
- Documentation pages are referenced by their pagename, e.g. `page: authoring-markdown`
- External links have a `text` and a `url` key to define where they point.

## Translation

Both `caption` and `text` elements are strings that potentially need to be translated into multiple languages
and are therefore stored in a special file. This file should be located in `docs/_data/en/toc_text.yml`, where `en`
is a language code. This file should contain an entry for each `caption` and `text` entry in the TOC. For example,
for the TOC shown above, the following `docs/_data/en/toc_text.yml` would be needed:

```
authoring: Authoring docs
markdown-cheatsheet: Markdown Format
setting-up: Installation
developing: Developing tk-doc-generator
```
