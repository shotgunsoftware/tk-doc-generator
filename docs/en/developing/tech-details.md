# Technical Details

This document covers technical details around the internals of the repository and how to maintain it.

## Updating the theme version

In order to update the theme version, you need to rebuild the `Gemfile.lock` to match
the latest versions of things:

- Make the necessary changes to the `Gemfile`
- Run `scripts/docker-bash.sh` to get a bash terminal inside the docker container.
    - You'll need docker installed for this.
- Inside docker bash, execute
    - `cd tk-doc-generator`
    - `bundle install -deployment`
    - A new `Gemfile.lock` will be generated in the container.
- Replace your `Gemfile.lock` file with the one generated by the container.
