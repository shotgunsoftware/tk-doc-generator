# Handling figures, screenshots and diagrams

When including images, figures, screenshots and diagrams, follow these guidelines:

## Screenshots
- Screenshots should be 144dpi and stored in png format
- Post processing should be kept to a minimum
- We are not translating any graphics, so text should be kept to a minimum.
- If possible, screenshot an entire window rather than cropping the image
    - Use CMD+SHIFT+4 on the mac for easy screenshots of windows
 
## Diagrams and figures
- Use [draw.io](https://www.draw.io/) to author diagrams.
- The source file should be saved next to the image in github.
- [Open sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans) or similar should be used for text.
- We are not translating any images, so text should be kept to a minimum.
- Exported images should be 144dpi and stored in png format.
- Graphics should be functional in style, typically using grayscales only.
