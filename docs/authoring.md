# Authoring Developer Documentation

Once you have [integrated](./integrating) this repo into your project,
writing docs is easy. Use standard markdown to create your content and 
for each file add a special header on the following form:

```

```

## This repository is a sample

This repository serves as an example of how you can author your documentation.

## Formatting

The theme used to generate documentation can be found [here](https://github.com/shotgunsoftware/just-the-docs).
In addition to standard markdown, it supports several extensions. For a reference, check out the [theme documentation](https://pmarsceill.github.io/just-the-docs/). 

## Special Pages

The following special pages exist:

### Landing page

If you want to add a landing page to your documentation, create the 
following three files:

- A markdown file (typically `index.md`) with its `permalink` setting set to `/`.
  This file should be using the `landing_page` layout. For an example, see
  [the tk-doc-generator landing page](https://github.com/shotgunsoftware/tk-doc-generator/blob/master/docs/index.md).

- A file `_data/landing_page.yml` to describe the content. For an example, 
  see [the tk-doc-generator landing page](https://github.com/shotgunsoftware/tk-doc-generator/blob/master/docs/_data/landing_page.yaml).

- A file `_data/landing_page_text.yml` containing the content. For an example, see 
  the landing page for [this documentation](https://github.com/shotgunsoftware/tk-doc-generator/blob/master/docs/_data/landing_page_text.yml).

# Multiple languages

The documentation generator supports multiple languages (i18n) support via 
[polyglot](https://polyglot.untra.io). For more information, see its documentation.
